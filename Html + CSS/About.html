<h1>About us: The creaters of Plan Easy</h1>

<br>
<p>	Our goal for this web app is to help 
make it easier for people around the world to 
make plans. Too often people try to plan but 
give up since no one can add to the schedule. 
Hopefully with this web app everybody will be 
able to plan events for even the biggest events.
